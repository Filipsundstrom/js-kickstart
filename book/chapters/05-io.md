# Chapter 5: Input & Output

> Learn how to make your programs interactive by getting input from users and displaying meaningful output.

## üéØ Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand what Input/Output (I/O) means in programming
- Know how to display output using `console.log()`
- Learn how to get user input using `prompt-sync`
- Be able to create interactive programs that respond to user input
- Understand how to convert between strings and numbers
- Complete a hands-on exercise that greets users by name

> **üìö Study Tip:** This chapter covers the core concepts of input and output first, then shows some advanced patterns and user experience tips. Focus on mastering `console.log()`, `prompt-sync`, and `Number()` conversion first - the other techniques are bonus skills you can learn later!

## üí¨ What is Input & Output?

**Input & Output (I/O)** is how programs communicate with users:

- **Input** ‚Üí Information going INTO the program (from user to computer)
- **Output** ‚Üí Information coming OUT of the program (from computer to user)

### Real-Life Analogy

Think of I/O like a conversation:

**Human Conversation:**
- **You say**: "What's your name?" (output)
- **Friend replies**: "Alice" (input)
- **You respond**: "Nice to meet you, Alice!" (output)

**Program Conversation:**
- **Program asks**: "What's your name?" (output)
- **User types**: "Alice" (input)
- **Program responds**: "Nice to meet you, Alice!" (output)

### Why I/O Matters

Without I/O, programs would be like:
- A calculator that can't show results
- A game that can't respond to player actions
- A website that can't accept form submissions

With I/O, programs become:
- **Interactive** ‚Üí Users can participate
- **Personalized** ‚Üí Programs can adapt to individual users
- **Useful** ‚Üí Programs can solve real-world problems

## üì∫ Output with console.log()

You've already been using `console.log()` for output! It displays information to the user.

### Basic Output

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
console.log("Welcome to our program!");
```

### Dynamic Output with Variables

```javascript
let userName = "Alice";
let score = 95;

console.log("Hello, " + userName + "!");
console.log("Your score is: " + score);
```

### Formatted Output

```javascript
let product = "Laptop";
let price = 999.99;
let tax = 79.99;
let total = price + tax;

console.log("=== Receipt ===");
console.log("Product: " + product);
console.log("Price: $" + price);
console.log("Tax: $" + tax);
console.log("Total: $" + total);
console.log("===============");
```

> **üìù Note:** This is just text formatting with `console.log()` - not a real receipt system! We're simply showing how to create neat, organized output.

## üì• Input with prompt-sync

To get input from users, we use a library called `prompt-sync`. It pauses the program and waits for the user to type something.

> **üí° Why prompt-sync?** In web browsers, JavaScript has a built-in `prompt()` function for user input. But in Node.js (which we use to run JavaScript files), we need to install `prompt-sync` to get the same functionality. This is normal and expected! Note: These examples are designed for Node.js - if you try them in a browser console, use `prompt()` instead of `prompt-sync`.

### Setting Up prompt-sync

**First time setup (run once):**
```bash
npm run setup:prompt
```

This installs the `prompt-sync` library that we'll use for user input.

### Basic Input Syntax

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let userInput = prompt("Your question here: ");
console.log("You entered: " + userInput);
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Import the library**: `const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();`
2. **Ask a question**: `prompt("What's your name? ")`
3. **Store the answer**: `let name = prompt("What's your name? ");`
4. **Use the answer**: `console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");`

### Complete Example

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let name = prompt("What's your name? ");
let age = prompt("How old are you? ");

console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
console.log("You are " + age + " years old.");
```

**Sample interaction:**
```
What's your name? Alice
How old are you? 25
Hello, Alice!
You are 25 years old.
```

> **üí° Tip:** Use clear, friendly prompts like `"What's your name? "` instead of short ones like `"Name: "`. This makes your programs more user-friendly from the start!

## üî¢ Working with Numbers from Input

**Important:** User input is always a **string**, even if the user types numbers!

> **üìù Note:** For now, assume users will type valid input. We'll learn how to handle invalid input (like typing letters when you expect numbers) in later chapters.

### The Problem

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let num1 = prompt("Enter first number: ");  // "10" (string)
let num2 = prompt("Enter second number: "); // "5" (string)
let sum = num1 + num2;                      // "105" (string concatenation!)

console.log("Sum: " + sum); // "Sum: 105" (wrong!)
```

### The Solution: Convert to Numbers

Use `Number()` to convert strings to numbers:

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let num1 = Number(prompt("Enter first number: "));  // 10 (number)
let num2 = Number(prompt("Enter second number: ")); // 5 (number)
let sum = num1 + num2;                              // 15 (addition!)

console.log("Sum: " + sum); // "Sum: 15" (correct!)
```

### üí° Good to Know: Other Conversion Methods

For most cases, `Number()` is all you need. But there are other options:

```javascript
let wholeNumber = parseInt(prompt("Enter a whole number: "));    // Converts to integer
let decimalNumber = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a decimal: "));     // Converts to decimal
```

**Best practice:** Stick with `Number()` unless you specifically need integer-only conversion.

## üí° Common I/O Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Greeting

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let name = prompt("What's your name? ");
console.log("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to our program.");
```

### Pattern 2: Calculator

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let num1 = Number(prompt("Enter first number: "));
let num2 = Number(prompt("Enter second number: "));

let sum = num1 + num2;
let difference = num1 - num2;
let product = num1 * num2;
let quotient = num1 / num2;

console.log("Results:");
console.log(num1 + " + " + num2 + " = " + sum);
console.log(num1 + " - " + num2 + " = " + difference);
console.log(num1 + " * " + num2 + " = " + product);
console.log(num1 + " / " + num2 + " = " + quotient);
```

### Pattern 3: Survey/Questionnaire (Bonus Practice)

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

console.log("=== Quick Survey ===");
let name = prompt("Name: ");
let age = Number(prompt("Age: "));
let city = prompt("City: ");
let hobby = prompt("Favorite hobby: ");

console.log("\n=== Your Information ===");
console.log("Name: " + name);
console.log("Age: " + age);
console.log("City: " + city);
console.log("Hobby: " + hobby);
console.log("Thank you for participating!");
```

### Pattern 4: Interactive Story (Bonus Practice)

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let heroName = prompt("What's your hero's name? ");
let weapon = prompt("What weapon do they carry? ");
let monster = prompt("What monster do they face? ");

console.log("\n=== Your Adventure ===");
console.log(heroName + " grabs their " + weapon + " and approaches the " + monster + ".");
console.log("The " + monster + " roars loudly!");
console.log(heroName + " bravely swings their " + weapon + " and defeats the beast!");
console.log("Victory belongs to " + heroName + "!");
```

## üéØ Practice Exercise: Greet User

Now it's time to create your first interactive program!

### Exercise Overview

**Goal:** Create a program that asks for the user's name and greets them personally.

**Location:** `exercises/05-io/01-greet-user/`

**What you'll do:**
- Ask the user for their name
- Store their response in a variable
- Display a personalized greeting

**Example interaction:**
```
What is your name? Alice
Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you!
```

### Getting Started

1. **Make sure prompt-sync is installed:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:prompt
   ```

2. **Navigate to the exercise folder**

3. **Open `script.js` in your editor**

4. **Replace the placeholder code**

5. **Test your script:** `node script.js`

6. **Run the automated test:** `npm run test:one -- 05-io`

### Tips for Success

- Don't forget to import prompt-sync at the top of your file
- Use a clear, friendly prompt message
- Store the user's input in a descriptive variable name
- Create a warm, personalized greeting message

## üß† Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### Mistake 1: Forgetting to Import prompt-sync

**Wrong:**
```javascript
let name = prompt("What's your name? ");  // Error: prompt is not defined
```

**Fixed:**
```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();
let name = prompt("What's your name? ");
```

### Mistake 2: Not Converting Numbers

**Wrong:**
```javascript
let age = prompt("How old are you? ");
let nextYear = age + 1;
console.log("Next year you'll be: " + nextYear); // "251" instead of 26
```

**Fixed:**
```javascript
let age = Number(prompt("How old are you? "));
let nextYear = age + 1;
console.log("Next year you'll be: " + nextYear); // 26
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Tip:** If you forget `Number()` conversion, your automated tests will fail! Tests expect numbers like `15`, but you'll get strings like `"15"`. This is actually a helpful debugging clue - if your math tests fail, check your `Number()` conversions first.

### Mistake 3: Missing Parentheses in require

**Wrong:**
```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync');  // Missing ()
```

**Fixed:**
```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();  // Correct
```

### Mistake 4: Not Installing prompt-sync

**Error message:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'prompt-sync'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
npm run setup:prompt
```

## üîç Debugging I/O Programs

### Test with Different Inputs

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let name = prompt("Name: ");
console.log("Debug - name:", name);
console.log("Debug - name type:", typeof name);

let age = Number(prompt("Age: "));
console.log("Debug - age:", age);
console.log("Debug - age type:", typeof age);
```

### Handle Empty Input (Advanced)

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let name = prompt("What's your name? ");
if (name === "") {
    name = "Anonymous";
}
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

### Validate Number Input (Advanced)

```javascript
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

let ageInput = prompt("How old are you? ");
let age = Number(ageInput);

if (isNaN(age)) {
    console.log("That's not a valid number!");
} else {
    console.log("You are " + age + " years old.");
}
```

## üé® Making Programs User-Friendly (Advanced)

### Clear Instructions

**Poor:**
```javascript
let x = prompt("x: ");
```

**Better:**
```javascript
let name = prompt("Please enter your name: ");
```

### Helpful Prompts

```javascript
let age = Number(prompt("Enter your age (numbers only): "));
let email = prompt("Enter your email address: ");
let phone = prompt("Enter your phone number (optional): ");
```

### Formatted Output

```javascript
console.log("\n=== Welcome ===");
console.log("Name: " + name);
console.log("Age: " + age);
console.log("===============\n");
```

### Progress Indicators

```javascript
console.log("Setting up your profile... (1/3)");
let name = prompt("Name: ");

console.log("Getting your details... (2/3)");
let age = Number(prompt("Age: "));

console.log("Finalizing... (3/3)");
let city = prompt("City: ");

console.log("Profile complete!");
```
