## 📝 Your Task

1. **What should a "Hello, World!" program do?**  
   - Write your answer in 1–2 sentences.

2. **Who is the audience for this program?**  
   - Who will see the output?

3. **Human recipe:** Explain to a friend how to say "Hello, World!" out loud, step by step.  
   Example:  
   - Step 1: Open your mouth  
   - Step 2: Say "Hello"  
   - Step 3: Say "World"  

4. **Computer recipe:** Translate this into plain-English instructions a computer could follow to display "Hello, World!".  

5. **Sequence check:** Do the steps need to happen in a specific order? What would happen if they were reversed?  

6. **Predict output:** When the program runs, what exactly should appear on the screen?  

7. **Bonus:** What if the program should greet *you by name* (e.g., “Hello, Alice!”)? What extra step would it need?
