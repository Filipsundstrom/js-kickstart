- **File naming**: Use kebab-case for directories, camelCase for JavaScript files
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces (no tabs)

### Exercise Guidelines

When creating or modifying exercises:

1. **Keep it simple**: Exercises should focus on one concept at a time
2. **Provide clear instructions**: Include step-by-step guidance in README files
3. **Include both files**: Always provide both `script.js` (for students) and `solution.js` (reference)
4. **Write comprehensive tests**: Ensure tests cover edge cases and provide helpful error messages
5. **Follow the pattern**: Look at existing exercises for structure and style

### Documentation Guidelines

- **Use clear, simple language**: Remember the target audience is beginners
- **Include examples**: Show don't just tell
- **Be consistent**: Follow the existing documentation style
- **Test instructions**: Ensure all commands and examples work as described

Before submitting a pull request:

- [ ] All existing tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] All solution tests pass (`npm run test:solutions`)
- [ ] New exercises include comprehensive tests
